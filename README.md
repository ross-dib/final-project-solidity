Hello! Thank you for taking the time to look at my first project writing smart contracts for building decentralized applications on the Ethereum network. 

For those who aren't familiar, Ethereum is a distributed ledger network inspired by predecessor blockchain like Bitcoin. Ethereum is pretty much a distributed computing platform that allows peer-to-peer transactons on immutable blockchain ledger. It allows blocks of code called smart contracts to facilitate these transactions, and that's where this project makes an entrance.

My application is split into two contracts: a Marketplace contract and a StoreOwner contract. 
The marketplace holds all of the admins and store owner Externally Owned Addresses, as well as StoreOwner contract addresses.

In order to operate my contracts, follow the steps below:
1) deploy one marketplace contract on remix.com
2) add as many store owners as you like (which deploys the StoreOwner contract, must also upload to remix.com)
3) add stores and items to each StoreOwner contract
4) buy items from a seperate EOA from the StoreOwner Contract
5) Withdraw funds (only as an owner of the StoreOwner contract)
6) Lock all funds in StoreOwner Contract (only as admin)


I would like to thank you for interacting with my project! I hope this experience was as enjoyable for you as it was for me! I plan on building the front-end and deploying to the Ethereum mainnet, so lookout for new commits!
