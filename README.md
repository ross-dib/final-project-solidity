Hello! Thank you for taking the time to grade my project! Hopefully this wil be a bit easier to grade than others because you don't have to work through a buggy UI.
I ran out of time while building an interface, so I mostly focused on the contract. 
My application is split into two contracts: a Marketplace contract and a StoreOwner contract. 
The marketplace holds all of the admins and store owner Externally Owned Addresses, as well as StoreOwner contract addresses.

In order to work my contracts, follow the steps below:
1) deploy one marketplace contract
2) add as many store owners as you like (which deploys the StoreOwner contract)
3) add stores and items to each StoreOwner contract
4) buy items from a seperate EOA from the StoreOwner Contract
5) Withdraw funds (only as an owner of the StoreOwner contract)
6) Lock all funds in StoreOwner Contract (only as admin)

I would like to thank you for interacting with my project! I hope this experience was as enjoyable for you as it was for me!
